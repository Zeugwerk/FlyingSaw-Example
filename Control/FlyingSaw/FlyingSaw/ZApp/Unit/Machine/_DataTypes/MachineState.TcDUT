    <Declaration><![CDATA[/// This enumeration contains all used defined sequences of a unit.
/// Per default a unit makes use of the states that are contained in (UnitStateDefault)[xref:ZApplication.UnitStateDefault]. However,
/// most of the time a unit need to perform some application depend sequences that can be performed by putting the unit into userdefined states.
/// For instance, a robotic unit could use the state (automatic)[xref:ZApplication.UnitStateDefault] to lift an object from point A to point B,
/// a userdefined state could be used to open and close the robotic-units gripper, respectively
